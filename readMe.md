# Weather Tracker
## Description
It's a website that gives you weather data.  

## Usage
Enter a city name into the text box and hit submit.  The next 5 days of weather (possibly less depending on time zones) will be displayed. Clicking on one of the city boxes that are generated based off of previous searches will bring up the weather for that city.

## Problems
2 word cities don't seem to work.  For example, New York has no weather, which can't be right.  This is almost certainly a problem with my Api call.  There are no weather images because I could find them.
